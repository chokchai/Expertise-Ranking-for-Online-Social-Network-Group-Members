1733062735: (lv.3 - 0.6974744159317332)
I think, because in java conventions the class name is capitalized!

597600354: (lv.5 - 195.84346225344476)
But more importantly, the compiler won't allow it. If you triedto instantiate a B
B b = new B();
this invokes the no-arg compiler-constructed constructor, which would invoke the super() of test - and there isn't one. Change to:

541351926: (lv.4 - 0.8244337135488933)
you need to change the Access level method for 'class test' to 'public class test' because you have two classes in the same physical class file and one of them must be 'public', so because 'class B' extends 'class test', then 'class test' is the upper class.....plus i agree with Chromy Gábor's point regarding java naming conventions, the first character of the class name is Capitalized.....(n_n)

100000184701303: (lv.2 - 0.07152379865380733)

here test inherits Object class n thru multilevel inheritence B inherits Object n thus have all the methods of Object clas bcoz if B inherits Object directly then there wud b multipl inheritenc which is nt posibl in java

How can find the length of the string (whitespaces are not included in that length)

-----

1197894644: (lv.5 - 37.640462089176346)
Here's one way.

String aString = "this is a string.";
aString = aString.replaceAll("\\s","")
int lengthWithoutWhitespace = aString.length();

1660065721: (lv.5 - 27.67342405650915)
If you want to remove spaces only then use, either:

string.replace(" ", "").length() 

- or -

public int lengthWithoutSpace(String str) {
	int count = 0;
	if (str!=null && str.length() > 0) {
		for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
			if (!Character.isSpaceChar(c)) {
				count++;
			}       
		}
	}
	return count; 
}

(2nd option performs 3-5x times faster than  replace(CharSequence, CharSquence) because of internal invoking of Pattern. Also see: http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7-b147/java/lang/String.java#String.replace%28java.lang.CharSequence%2Cjava.lang.CharSequence%29

If you want to remove the white space then I recommend to use Apache Commons Lang (again and again :-) ) which performs equally same like my source: 
http://commons.apache.org/lang/api/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html#deleteWhitespace(java.lang.String)"

1401705828: (lv.5 - 4.744489756153341)
doing the same job no difference

100000087830967: (lv.2 - 0.14137215402590267)
Both expression are same but x+=10 is provide fast execution from the ...x=x+10.differece is in b/w execution time..

100000337629968: (lv.3 - 0.6713358892651549)
there is a difference...It's explained in the OCP books...suppose you have an int x and that your 10 is of type long. Then x = x + y won't compile, but x += y will...That's because the += can tackel implicit casting while the other expression can't

1759436944: (lv.5 - 36.59940416526925)
x=x+10; in JVM assembly:
   2: iload_1
   3: iconst_1
   4: iadd
   5: istore_1
x+=10; in JVM assembly:
   2: iinc 1, 1

If JVM followed a RISC architecture then the first code should take 16 cycles for the JVM CPU to execute, and the second opcode should only take 4 cycles to execute.

what algorithm is used in eclipse/netbeans or any ide to change color of a keyword or identifier, whenever we type.
how they recognize that it is a keyword ??? they continue search for a keyword or anything else???

-----

100000496758301: (lv.2 - 0.05540357861509949) 
hmmmmm according to my guess, those IDE's will store the desired keywords in a database and applies color to the keyword when we type it. This is only my guess. Don't know whether it is true or not.

827008289: (lv.3 - 0.7550780442924616)
they are using sintax analizer... and lexic.. automatons.

597600354: (lv.5 - 195.84346225344476)
Suppose the code contained:
 System.out.println("void");
A simple keyword search would show void as a keyword.
This is called syntax coloring. It applies not just to keywords, but to comments, identifiers, contants and so on.
The process is:
1. Do a syntax analysis of the code
2. Color according to syntax, or show error

Can someone explain the difference between Interfaces and Abstract Class ??

-----

100000418343412: (lv.2 - 0.054334744473905315)
Abstract Class can contain another methods not Abstract but the Interface all it's methods are abstract

100000525103083: (lv.3 - 0.7547152526241344)
Interfaces are like classes, consists of method signature or declaration, defination of that method provide @ implemention time. 
Abstract classes are classes which consist incomplete as well as complete methods...

100001131558881: (lv.3 - 0.708338740044558)
interfaces are like contracts, if you tell your class "implement" the interface abc, you have to implement all its methods in this class.  an abstract method is like Noor Ul Huda said. if one of your classes inherit an abstract class (which is filled with incomplete and complete methods) you can use the implemented methods and you can override the incomplete methods when you need them.

1809925606: (lv.5 - 6.2989620083107685)
take a look at this
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html

1134568005: (lv.5 - 1.0943168543842612)
Interfaces are used to define a default behavior whereas abstract classes are used to set a default behavior. Interfaces are came into light to remove the ambiguity caused by using several types of inheritances like multiple, hybrid in C++. Java basically is developed to overcome the drawbacks of C++.

Why do we use "Super" keyword in java

-----

100001512263103: (lv.3 - 0.7477434372284364)
super keyword is used to call the method or super class or to call the parametrized constructor or super class.

522647441: (lv.5 - 1.117671744335653)
Is it really so bad that a member of a dedicated Java specific group has asked about the super keyword? Maybe this member has already 'Googled' as the group rules dictate but required further clarity and therefore posted to this group. I know I had some difficulty nderstading inheritnace in Java when I first started out.

1662410682: (lv.5 - 158.13685602918957)
actually, yes, Barry, it is. you mean to tell me, that by the link I've shown, which is the very first result in google, you wouldn't have understood the super keyword? 
it says exactly the same as wath Kailash answered, with code examples to go with it.
Aqib didn't state: I've seen/read this, but I still doubt, nor does he say: I think the super does this, but I'm not sure.
he just asked a very basic question that is covered in every textbook out there. if putting some effort in it is too hard, maybe development isn't exactly the field you want to go in.

I will really appreciate if a sun developer helped me with this question:
what is the difference between running the application as an applet and running it through "java web start"?
Thanks in advance

-----

1056865120: (lv.3 - 0.3321362863010173)
Java Web Start is simply a way to deploy applications to an end-user via the web  whereas an Applet actually runs in the browser.

1832512304: (lv.2 - 0.17181346465023647)
so if I have to run an applet that needs accessing permissions to the system(readding writing-deletion), do I have to directly launch the applet through the web browser or do I have to run it via "Java web Start" ?

553595095: (lv.2 - 0.04871782295037756)
most system admins would disallow applets from accessing the machine, so i think through java web start might be a good idea, unless you know for a fact that the admin will allow your applet to run normally

100000019696880: (lv.3 - 0.2530121718013977)
as i know.. JRE can't be binded in JRE... JRE must be installed on that system. if u r trying to run it on some windows OS, than u can bind the JRE with ur application in an .exe
all u need is "exe4j" to make exe of your application & "installcreator" to make an installer and bind jre with it.

100000067690477: (lv.5 - 3.983822354539271)

1. read the user input

4. display it to the user.

100003008265694: (lv.4 - 0.9019229249846368)
For the sorting, you could use recursion. If you are unaware about what it is, Google it. It can be very useful in the right situation.

u can store it in hasset and use Collections.sort to sort elements. But if u r sorting a user defined objects then the class shud implements Comparable and provide the body of compareTo in which u can decide on which cretaria ur elements to b sorted

You'll either need to have the jar of the invoked program as a dependency, in that invokes and do a method call or send an http request to the invoked program.
The latter will need the invoked program to listen to request from a specific port and the invoker program to send the request to the same port (host is assumed to be the same). http rest would be preferable here. Both the programs should be up.

Structure it using class files and packages. If you start a new app it will run in a separate JVM and communication between JVMs is very difficult. Create new package in same app if teh activity is very different. Bt probably just structure by class files. If teh interaction between objects is messy, re-consider your class desgn.

You are dealing with three things:
A java.util.Date instance, which represents a moment in time
The appearance of that moment as a text String, which is what SimpleDateFormat gives you.
The date/time in a database, which java.sql.Date represents.

Ant, use the SimpleDateFormat to convert the string into an Date object, the format above is perfectly parseable with simpleDateformat
look at the link Sachin gave you above, and you will see the characters needed for the conversion..  but ehre is an hint, use the characters d M and y in your conversion string..
NOTE however that java.util.date does ALWAYS contain date AND time, so after conversion you will get a date containing the sate you want, and the time 00:00:00.0 (hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds) 
but that should not be a problem when inserting it into the database
